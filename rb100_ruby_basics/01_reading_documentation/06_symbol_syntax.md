Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a **Symbol** that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Symbols

> You may reference a symbol using a colon: :my_symbol.

To represent my name, I would want to use `:Chanda`.
